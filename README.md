4. The first half of the first day of class per week will be used for Whiteboarding practice. The Instructor and TA will select up to 3 sample problems for the class to work on until lunch time. After lunch time, the class will reconvene and review all the sample problems.
5. All google feedback forms will be reviewed by the Instructor and/or TA at the end of every week.
6. The morning after an assignment has been submitted, Instructor will ask for volunteers to walk the class through the assignment. The class will then group code review the volunteer's code.
