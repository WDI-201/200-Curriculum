## WDI-201 Backend Development: Web Servers and Databases

### Overview

WDI-201 will introduce students to web servers and server-side functionality. Students will learn how to use NPM to install and save packages. Students will learn how to use ExpressJS to create and run a web server. Students will test their ExpressJS server using Postman. Students will learn the basics of databases, including the benefits and drawbacks of SQL vs NoSQL databases. Students will create and work with their own MongoDB database.

## WDI-204 Fullstack Final Project

### Overview

In WDI-204, students will be given full autonomy to plan, design and implement their own fullstack project. Students will have the option of working in teams or alone to complete their project. Students will be required to create their own milestone list, front-end component wireframe mockup, and back-end architecture plan/diagram. Students will be required to check in with instructors on morning SCRUM as well as track their progress in JIRA as if they were working in a professional environment.

### Capstone Project
* Project Planing and Breakdown
	* Milestones
	* Front-end Component Mockup
	* Back-end Architecture Diagram
	* Scrum
